## Project Summary

This project is an Electron and JavaScript application designed to connect to the Twitch API to retrieve chat messages in real-time. The application integrates Twitch chat functionality with a game emulator, enabling chat messages to be converted into automated inputs within the emulator.

### Key Features

- **Twitch API Integration:** Utilizes Twitch authentication credentials to connect to the API and subscribe to chat messages in specific channels.
- **Message Retrieval:** Implements a real-time listening system to capture chat messages and process them as needed.
- **Emulator Integration:** Translates chat messages into commands or inputs that are sent to the game emulator, allowing dynamic interaction between Twitch users and the game.
- **User Interface (UI):** Includes an Electron-based interface for configuring Twitch connections, selecting the game emulator, and managing the integration between both.

This project offers an innovative solution to enhance interactivity during Twitch streams by allowing viewers to directly influence the gaming experience through their chat messages.

### Requirements

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
- Familiarity with the Twitch API
- Experience with Electron for desktop applications
- Understanding of game emulator integration and input handling

This project is ideal for developers interested in creating interactive applications and integrating live streaming platforms with customized gaming experiences.
